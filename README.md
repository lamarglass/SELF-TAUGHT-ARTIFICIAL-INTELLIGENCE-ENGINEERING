# AI Science + Engineering Study Plan

This repository documents my **18-month journey** to mastering **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Science and Engineering**.  
It is structured into stages ‚Äî from foundational programming and mathematics, to advanced deep learning, deployment, and real-world applications.  

The goal is to build **strong theoretical foundations**, **hands-on projects**, and a **portfolio** that demonstrates applied AI skills.
